# PicSync: Real-Time Multi-User Image Interaction Platform

A premium, high-performance web application built for seamless real-time image engagement. This project was developed for the **FotoOwl** technical assessment, focusing on real-time synchronization, architectural clarity, and exceptional UX.

## 🚀 Live Demo
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/kunals182/image-interact-app.git

## 🌟 Core Features

- **Infinite Scrolling Gallery**: High-resolution photography fetched dynamically from Unsplash.
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Instant syncing of comments and emoji reactions using **InstantDB**.
- **Global Activity Feed**: A live bridge between all users, enabling instant navigation to interacting images.
- **Persistent Identities**: Persistent random usernames and unique color profiles stored via Zustand.
- **Premium UI**: Glassmorphic dark-mode design with smooth Framer Motion animations.

## 🔌 API Handling Strategy

The application uses a **Layered Data Strategy**:
1. **Primary Layer**: Unsplash API for high-quality production images.
2. **Fallback Layer**: If the API key is missing or rate-limited, the system automatically switches to a robust mockup service (`picsum.photos`) to ensure zero-downtime during evaluation.
3. **Caching**: TanStack Query (React Query) handles deduplication, caching, and background synchronization of image metadata.

## 💾 InstantDB Schema & Usage

The data layer is built on **InstantDB**, a graph-based, local-first database that provides out-of-the-box real-time subscriptions.

### Schema Entity: `interactions`
```typescript
{
  type: 'like' | 'emoji' | 'comment',
  imageId: string,    // Matches Unsplash Image ID
  payload: string,    // Stores the emoji char or comment text
  username: string,   // Author of the interaction
  userColor: string,  // UI personalization
  timestamp: number   // Global ordering
}
```
**Why InstantDB?** It allows us to treat the database like a local state with `db.useQuery`, handling all WebSocket logic and optimistic updates automatically.

## 🏗️ Key React Decisions

- **Global Modal Management**: Lifted the `FocusedImageView` to the `App` level using a central **Zustand** store. This allows the sidebar feed to trigger image modals application-wide.
- **Performance Optimization**: 
    - Used `useCallback` for transaction handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders in deep component trees.
    - `useMemo` for derived states like interaction filtering and emoji grouping.
- **Atomic Components**: Separated concerns into `Gallery`, `ActivityFeed`, and `FocusedImageView` for better maintainability.

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions

- **Real-Time Context Switching**: *Challenge:* How to open the correct image modal when a user clicks a "comment" alert in the global feed. *Solution:* Implemented a global `selectedImage` state in Zustand and a dedicated `fetchImageById` service to resolve image metadata on-the-fly.
- **Toggling Reactions**: *Challenge:* Users shouldn't be able to spam multiple same emojis. *Solution:* Implemented a "Toggle" logic that checks for existing authorship of a specific emoji type before transacting.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

1. **Optimistic UI for Deletions**: Improve the "snappiness" of deleting personal comments.
2. **Search & Filter**: Add category-based browsing through Unsplash topic APIs.
3. **Advanced Permissions**: Implement full Auth (Clerk/Lucide) for true user ownership beyond random identities.
